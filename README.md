# Decentralized File System

A simple decentralized file system built on a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) in Java. Files are stored locally on peers and discovered via the DHT, with HTTP-based file transfers.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- All peers must be on the same network or have accessible IPs

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mrunal-Shah7/decentro.git
   cd decentro
